# ML Shephard Dog
 Reinforcement Learning agent dog learns to herd a sheep into the destination point.
 This project was made in Unity based on the Unity ML-Agents Framework for university subject named "introduction to Reinforcement Learning".
 Made by Tünde Tutor and Andrew Czanik.
 
 Unfortunately, we had to remove the sheep and dog assets, because these are paid assets from the assetstore and this is a public domain repository.
 If you have these models, you can import them to the project. Or if you want to purchase them you can find them here: [Sheep](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/mammals/xue-the-sheep-quirky-series-118256) [Dog](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/mammals/oscar-the-dog-quirky-series-119972)
 You can use boxes as characters if you want. There may be a replacement asset in the future.
